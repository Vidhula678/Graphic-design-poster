# Graphic-design-poster
Task 1 of my intership at skillcraft technology where the topic is Creating a poster or flyer on awareness on anything.
For making awareness poster I came up with the Theme of
🔴 “Every Journey Matters – Let’s Make Transport Safer”

The objective of my poster is,
Raise awareness about the increase in public transport accidents.
Urge authorities and citizens to prioritize safety, vigilance, and accountability.
Encourage the public to demand better safety measures and be cautious passengers.

🚨 Another Accident. Another Life Lost. When Will It Stop?

In recent years, we've witnessed a troubling rise in public transport accidents from devastating bus crashes and train derailments to flight and ferry disasters. Each incident leaves behind shattered families, unanswered questions, and preventable tragedy.
My latest awareness poster highlights this ongoing crisis and calls for action.
Negligence, poor maintenance, overspeeding, and outdated safety protocols must be addressed.
We need to push for policy reforms, stricter enforcement, and a culture of safety-first thinking.
🛑 This is not just a government issue—it’s a citizen issue.
 Let’s demand safer roads and transport systems. Let’s stay alert, informed, and involved.
